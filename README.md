# 🚀 Backend Learning Projects

![alt text](backendImff.png)
This repository is a **collection of backend projects** I built while learning **Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Authentication, and APIs**.
Projects are organized **day-wise** (Day-01, Day-02, …) and also include **real practice apps** like blogs, authentication systems, and file uploads.
